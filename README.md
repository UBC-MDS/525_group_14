## Project overview

The daily rainfall dataset for New South Wales (NSW), Australia is a valuable resource for researchers and environmental specialists seeking to understand and analyze rainfall patterns in the region. This dataset spans from 1889 to 2014 and provides detailed information on rainfall recorded at various weather stations throughout NSW. It is particularly useful for identifying long-term trends in rainfall patterns, including those caused by climate change, natural disasters, and other environmental factors. 

The dataset, which we will utilize in this project, is derived from CMIP6, a global cooperative initiative that brings together climate modeling outputs from multiple research groups. It is available on the figshare repository and has been sourced to develop an ensemble model that uses different outputs to make predictions. 

Our project aims to leverage this extensive dataset of approximately 6 GB to create and deploy ensemble machine learning models in the cloud, enabling us to predict daily rainfall in Australia. We hope to build and refine our ML models through this project, gaining valuable experience in working with large datasets, ensemble models, and cloud deployment.
