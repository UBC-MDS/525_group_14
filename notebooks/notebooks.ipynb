    "- In this milestone, we are looking for a well-documented and self-explanatory notebook that explores different options to tackle big data on your laptop.\n",
    "- Please discuss any challenges or difficulties you faced when dealing with this large amount of data on your laptop. You can stop combining the data if it takes more than 30 minutes. Briefly explain your approach to overcoming the challenges or reasons why you could not overcome them.\n",
    "- For questions 5 and 6, you are free to choose any exploratory data analysis (EDA) task you want. Visualization is not necessary; summarizing the data is enough. However, if you want to install additional packages for visualization that are not included in the .yml file, feel free to install them on top of your notebook. If you want to install packages in R, you can do so using `install.packages(\"dplyr\")` under `%%R` magic cell.\n",
